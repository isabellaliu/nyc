## Asian
### Ramen
Ippudo

> Multiple locations but original is in the [East Village]
(http://www.yelp.com/biz/ippudo-ny-new-york) and would recommend checking
that one. Ippudo does everything well. Recommend any ramen and the pork
buns are a must. Also has good atmosphere.

[Totto Ramen](http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=totto+ramen&find_loc=New+York%2C+NY&ns=1)

> Now with multiple locations. When I was there they only had the Theater
District location which is in the style of Tokyo ramen bars (no ambience).
Totto offers a lighter take on ramen but still shockingly tasty and
satisfying.


Honestly, NYC is an amazing place to get ramen. There are so many chefs and
restaurants who are just killing it at the ramen game. [Here's a more extensive
list](http://www.grubstreet.com/2015/07/best-new-york-ramen.html) but the
two mentioned above are NY classics for a reason. Most of these places
(including Ippudo and Totto) may have long waits so try to go in the middle
of the day instead of at peak dinning hours.

### Sushi
[Sushi of Gari](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-of-gari-new-york)

> Multiple locations also but would suggest only making the trip to the
flagship on the Upper East Side. They take an experimental approach to the
traditional omakase. You have to get the omakase (or opt for the half if
the full tasting is too much), but it will blow your mind. Flavor, texture,
execution will be great.


### Japanese
[Kajitsu](http://www.yelp.com/biz/kajitsu-new-york-3)

> Vegan / vegetarian restaurant that feels at once high quality as well as
ascetic and Buddhist. Authentic, clean, inspired -- very different
experience. Last time I was there I was seated next to Ed Norton.


[Yakitori Totto](http://www.yelp.com/biz/yakitori-totto-new-york)

> For Japanese yakitori (grilled food). Very high quality and recommend the
eggplant dish.

[Takashi](http://www.yelp.com/biz/takashi-new-york)

> For more grilled meats, this one is a Japanese Korean hybrid. It's heavy
and smoky inside but worth it. Everything is super fresh and savory.


### New  / Other Asian
[Pok Pok NY](http://www.yelp.com/biz/pok-pok-ny-brooklyn-3) (Thai / New Thai)

> The restaurateur behind Pok Pok started in Portland and became famous with
his Vietnamese fried chicken. He then opened up a small stand on the Lower
East Side in NYC and then opened up this restaurant in Brooklyn. It is far
but I liked the trek and it made entering the restaurant a very special
experience. Plus the food was AWESOME. I've eaten tons of Thai food
(including in Thailand) but this was authentic, fresh, and delicate. That's
not easy to find in what is usually takeout territory. Highly recommend
despite the recent Yelp reviews.


[SriPraPhai](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sripraphai-thai-restaurant-woodside) (Thai)

> Located in Queens, this one is also a trek to get here but it doesn't get
more about the food than this place. It's an unassuming shop with
fluorescent lighting that is another NYC classic for good reason.


While I lived in NYC, more and more really amazing Thai restaurants opened
up. Here's a [full list](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/new-york/best-thai-food-nyc-restaurants).
One that I never got a chance to try but strongly recommend is Uncle Boons.

[Hangawi](http://www.yelp.com/biz/hangawi-new-york)

> Vegetarian Korean food. In a similar vein to Kajitsu but Korean. Really
tasty, delicate food. You'll feel more alive and alert after having an
inspired, invigorating meal. Unique experience, highly recommend trying
either Kajitsu or Hangawi.


[Momofuku Ko / Milk / Noodle / Ssam Bar](http://www.momofuku.com/noodle/default.asp)

> David Chang is the restaurateur behind the Momofuku brand. He also
publishes Lucky Peach magazine and has an innovative test / molecular
gastronomy kitchen in Brooklyn. He's super critically acclaimed. I don't
love his food but worth knowing about and possibly trying. Momofuku Milk is
the dessert bar and has some interesting stuff. My favorite is the crack
pie, but another popular choice is the cereal milk ice cream.

[Mission Chinese](http://www.yelp.com/biz/mission-chinese-food-new-york-2)

> Danny Bowien made his name in SF with the original Mission Chinese but I
feel like he and his hipster restaurants fit in NYC better. Food is good --
very spicy / salty and definitely targeted at white millennial hipster
demographic. That said, it's a fun experience and the food is tasty though
too much for the every day.


RedFarm

> An irreverent / kitschy / new Asian take on dim sum. Not too crazy but just
enough to keep you alert and taste buds alive. Again, high quality,
delicate, well-balanced flavors in a playful hipster atmosphere. Two
locations now -- the [West Village](http://www.yelp.com/biz/redfarm-new-york) location
was the only one that was open when I was in NYC and would recommend that
one for atmosphere.


[Shanghai Cafe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/shanghai-cafe-new-york-4)

> For soup dumplings. No frills and would focus on the smaller dishes (not
the more expensive ones on the back of the menu).


## Pasta
[Osteria Morini](http://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-morini-new-york)

> Pasta is the highlight at this Michael White restaurant. You will know how
much you've been missing out on when you bite into their pasta. It's
perfectly al dente and often made in house.

> Pro Tip: Monday nights is $10 homemade pasta


[Il Buco Alimentari & Vineria](http://www.yelp.com/biz/il-buco-alimentari-and-vineria-new-york-2)

> Also has really solid pasta but overall great Italian / New American
restaurant. Good service and relaxed but tasteful atmosphere.


[L'Artusi](http://www.yelp.com/biz/l-artusi-new-york)

> Pasta is also a focus at this restaurant. Very popular choice among New
Yorkers. Morini and Il Buco are my personal favorites but this place is
also very good. Olive oil cake to finish the meal here is nice. More
bustling than the other two.


## Pizza

### Fancy

[Rubirosa](http://www.yelp.com/biz/rubirosa-new-york-2)

> MUST GET THE VODKA PIZZA. Once you've had that, you're done. The pasta is
also ok but focus on the vodka pizza.


[Keste](http://www.yelp.com/biz/keste-pizza-and-vino-new-york)

> Really good Neapolitan pizza. Can't go wrong with any of the pizzas here.


[Motorino](http://www.yelp.com/biz/motorino-new-york)

> Also good but I prefer Rubirosa's vodka and Keste's pizzas. Roberta's out
in Brooklyn is also popular but to me it's just more hipster.


###  NY-Style Slice

[Joe's](http://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-pizza-new-york-4)

> Though Joe's is really good and famous, any corner pizza shop that is
selling by the slice is likely to have awesome NY-style pizza for cheap.
Here's a [guy](http://www.npr.org/books/titles/431650563/slice-harvester-a-memoir-in-pizza#excerpt)
who
took 2 years to try every pizza sold by the slice in NYC and then wrote a
book and blog about it.


###  Other Pizza Institutions
[Grimaldi's](http://www.grimaldis-pizza.com/home)

> One of the most famous NY pizzerias. Original location is in Brooklyn under
the bridge.


[Here's another final verdict on 'za in NYC.](http://gothamist.com/2015/09/17/best_pizza_nyc_final.php)

## Brunch
[Freeman's](http://www.yelp.com/biz/freemans-new-york-3)

> Uppity, New England cum hipster crowd. Great ambience, best brunch fare
I've ever had.


[Shopsin's](http://www.yelp.com/biz/shopsins-new-york)

> MUST GO HERE. Crazy menu, crazy food somehow all actually good. No ambience
in the middle of a market with a few tables. A total experience and NY
institution.


## New American
[MWells](http://magasinwells.com/)

> You MUST go to MWells (either Dinette or Steakhouse). One of my favorite
restaurant groups -- owners are a husband and wife team half from Queens
and half from Montreal. Their restaurants are in Queens and the food takes
on the adventure and richness of Montreal cuisine. Crazy weird stuff,
innovative, worth every second getting there, waiting, and eating.


[ABC Kitchen](http://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york)

## Steak
[Peter Luger's](http://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-steak-house-brooklyn)

[Keen's](http://www.yelp.com/biz/keens-steakhouse-new-york)

Both Peter Luger's and Keen's are NY institutions. Luger's is SO good.
Keen's is a riot to experience (kitschy decor and blue-blood crowd) and
also good.


## Mexican
[Hecho en Dumbo](http://www.yelp.com/biz/hecho-en-dumbo-new-york)

> Had the bone marrow taco with mom the last time I was there. Really tasty
and interesting.


[El Toro Blanco](http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-toro-blanco-new-york)

> Was one of my go-tos when I hung out in the West Village.

## Burgers
Shake Shack

> Many locations but I would go to the [original](http://www.yelp.com/biz/shake-shack-new-york-2) shack in Madison Square
Park. Get the shack stack, a concrete (or beer or wine to pair), and
fries!!!


[Minetta Tavern](http://www.yelp.com/biz/minetta-tavern-new-york)

> Great vibe, hard to get in. My favorite fancy burger in NYC.


[JG Melon](http://www.yelp.com/biz/jg-melon-new-york)

> Like Shopsin's a lot of people don't know about JG Melon but it is a NY
institution and classic. Known for burgers and chili, the first time I
walked in I thought I had entered a snowy diner filled with New England
prep school families.


## Cheap Eats

*East Village / Lower East Side area*

[Crif Dogs](http://www.yelp.com/biz/crif-dogs-new-york)

> Creative hot dogs, also houses the phone booth entrance to the faux
speakeasy PDT (Please Don't Tell), which I strongly recommend.


[Tuck Shop](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tuck-shop-new-york)

> Australian meat pies that are surprisingly good quality and satisfying


[Xian Famous Foods](http://www.yelp.com/biz/xian-famous-foods-new-york-3)

> Multiple locations but this one is the easiest to get to. Chinese Muslim
food. Tasty, cheap, authentic.


[Baohaus](http://www.yelp.com/biz/baohaus-new-york-2)

> The restaurateur is also the guy behind Fresh Off the Boat TV series, Eddie
Huang. Taiwanese snacks and street food. Cheap and authentic.


[Chicken 'n' Rice Cart](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2)

> The go-to halal street meat food cart in Manhattan

## Jewish Deli / Eastern European Fare

[Katz's Deli](http://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york)

> Where part of the movie When Harry Met Sally was filmed.  Offers Jewish
deli food and is the most well-known Jewish deli in NYC.


[2nd Ave Deli](http://www.2ndavedeli.com/)

> My personal favorite Jewish deli on Manhattan.


[Veselka](http://www.yelp.com/biz/veselka-new-york)

> Get the borscht and pierogis. Bonus points for being open 24/7 and a go-to
cafe for NYU students.


[B&H Dairy](http://www.yelp.com/biz/b-and-h-dairy-new-york-2)

> A real diner and old-timey local favorite. Very authentic and at home.
Great soups (matzoh ball soup!), challah bread, pierogis. Cramped space but
perfect in every way!


[Russ and Daughters](http://www.yelp.com/biz/russ-and-daughters-new-york)

> Get your smoked salmon for your bagel here! I'm a bit out of date on where
to get bagels. You could totally at Russ & Daughters. My friends used to
get them at Zabar's supermarkets. I have two favorites but they were just
close to where I lived but don't remember their names.


## Dessert
[Levain](http://www.yelp.com/biz/levain-bakery-new-york)

> Insanely huge gooey cookies on the UWS. Worth the visit!!

[Doughnut Plant](http://doughnutplant.com/)

> Most well-known doughnut place in NYC. Has a lot of interesting bases and
types.


[Dough](http://www.yelp.com/biz/dough-new-york-2)

> Another doughnut option but out in Brooklyn.


[Magnolia Bakery](http://www.magnoliacupcakes.com/home.php)

> Cupcakes and banana bread pudding. I recommend the banana bread pudding and
either the vanilla-based or the chocolate-based cupcakes. Most famous
cupcake shop in NYC.


[Four and Twenty Blackbirds](http://www.yelp.com/biz/four-and-twenty-blackbirds-brooklyn)

> Because who wants cake when they can have pie!


## French Pastries

[Dominique Ansel](http://www.yelp.com/biz/dominique-ansel-bakery-new-york)

> The origin of the cronut. All pastries are incredible here, especially the
DKA.


[Maison Kayser](http://maison-kayser-usa.com/)

> Several locations, but really on point french breads and pastries. Also not
bad for a low-key weekend breakfast/brunch.



## Museums
* Metropolitan of Museum of Art
* The Guggenheim Museum
* *PS1* (the contemporary arm of the MOMA located in Long Island City -- my
ultimate favorite! The space it inhabits is an old public school and their
exhibits are super on point.)
* The Whitney
* New Museum
* American Museum of Natural History
* Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum

## Places
The High Line

> MUST GO. One of the largest outdoor urban spaces and parks. A perfect
confluence of art, urban design, and civic engagement. A lovely space that
manages to be peaceful and personal even while shared with other locals and
tourists.


Grand Central Terminal and New York City Public Library (main / research
branch)

> Both spaces are so beautiful and they are located close to each other in
Midtown East. Grand Central and Chrysler Building (adjacent) are the best
kind of Art Deco architecture and it's worth taking a tour inside the NYPL.


Bryant Park

> Used to be the location of NY Fashion Week, cute and close to NY Public
Library and Grand Central. Interesting set up modeled after Parisian parks.
I used to study for my GMATs here.


Wall Street and South Street Seaport

Meatpacking District

> Cobble stone streets and neighborhood are really cute during the day. There
are lots of nice boutiques and it's where Diane Von Furstenburg is
headquartered.  At night it is a popular spot for drinking and going out
among people who are willing to drop lots of money.


East Village, Alphabet City, and Lower East Side

> My personal favorite. One of the grittier, dirtier parts of Manhattan but
very safe. Tons of great, cheap food, dive bars, music shows on the LES.
Very young, rebellious and artsy in East Village. LES is the home of a ton
of great NYC history (immigrants, tenements, and civic life).


Central Park

> Walk around. Tavern on the Green is a classic New York / uppity place to
take a break and get a drink.


Lincoln Center and Columbus Circle

> A pretty affluent part of Manhattan, at the edge of the Central Park and
Lincoln Center is the new location of NY Fashion Week and home to the NY
Opera, Ballet, and Philharmonic and Julliard


Flatiron

> Check out Mario Bataly's new supermarket / restaurant space, [Eataly](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/dining/28eataly.html), Ace Hotel, Nomad
Hotel. Don't miss the Flatiron building that gives the district its name.


5th Avenue

> Beautiful to walk down late at night (after 11pm) when it's quiet and you
have the whole sidewalk to yourself. It's like Breakfast at Tiffany's.


UES (60s-70s) - conservative wealthy white people

UWS - liberal Jewish families

## Touristy
* Rockefeller Center (Check out ice skating rink and Christmas tree)
* Time Square (I actually love Time Square)
* Chinatown and Little Italy
* Empire State Building (I also love this one)
* Statue of Liberty


### Other Areas
* Coney Island
* Rockaway Beach
* Long Island City
* Williamsburg


## Shopping
* Barneys, Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth, Bloomingdales, and Macys (all
started in NYC and can visit their flagship stores)
* Apple store on 5th Ave and Central Park South (open 24/7)
* The Strand Bookstore
* Opening Ceremony (the uber hip boutique chain where I interned for a summer)
* Steven Alan (known for their plaid shirts, a staple brand for hipsters)
* [Story](http://thisisstory.com/) (the whole store changes periodically
according to themes)
* Brooklyn Flea Market (a MUST)



## Nightlife

### Speakeasies

[PDT (Please Don't Tell)](http://www.yelp.com/biz/please-dont-tell-new-york-2)

> Recommended, go through a phone booth located in Crif Dogs to get to PDT

[Dear Irving](http://www.yelp.com/biz/dear-irving-new-york)

[Campbell Apartment](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-campbell-apartment-new-york)

> My personal favorite. True to its period -- used to be the office of the
head of Grand Central hence the name. Older crowd, sexy in its slower pace
and setting.


[Apotheke](http://www.yelp.com/biz/apoth%C3%A9ke-new-york-2)

[Manderley Bar](https://foursquare.com/v/manderley-bar-at-the-mckittrick-hotel/4d95141361a3a1cdc6e27b42)

> The bar that is part of the Sleep No More building. Really sexy and usually
has live performances. Can get crowded when the SNM viewers are arriving and leaving.

### Venues
[Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-royal-palms-shuffleboard-club-brooklyn)

[Union Pool](http://www.yelp.com/biz/union-pool-brooklyn-2)

[Barcade](http://www.yelp.com/biz/barcade-brooklyn)

[Kinfolk](http://kinfolklife.com/94-wythe/)

Caveat: I've only been to Barcade but looked up a few more places that you
might like. If you're jonesing for a dance party, Williamsburg would be a
ton to check out. [Here's a good list](http://www.timeout.com/newyork/nightlife/best-nightlife-venues-in-williamsburg)
of where to go there.

If you want beer, [here are some biergartens and bars](http://ny.eater.com/maps/best-outdoor-bar-beer-gardens-new-york-city).

I would check out what live music shows are going on while you're there. I
don't love musicals, but New Yorker Magazine (as well as NYMag) will have a
thorough list and description of what is happening (band performances,
plays, musicals, dance, art exhibits, auctions). Download the New Yorker
app to get easy on the go access.

## Hotels
Ace Hotel

> Seattle-based boutique chain hotel, very hip and hipster, old-school
feeling and design and home to Breslin Bar and John Dory restaurants. Other
boutiques to know of include Nomad, Gramercy Park Hotel, the Jane Hotel,
Wythe Hotel (in Brooklyn).


Standard Hotel

> Scene-y hotel with their Boom Boom Room on the top and Le Bain bar
downstairs.


You can also check out iconic NYC hotels. I used to love walking to work in
the mornings and seeing people having their power breakfasts (closing power
deals) over breakfast at one of these hotels. They include the Plaza Hotel,
Waldorf-Astoria, Peninsula, St. Regis, Pierre.
